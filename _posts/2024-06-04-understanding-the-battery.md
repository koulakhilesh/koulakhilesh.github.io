Hello everyone! Today, we're going to dive into the `battery.py` module of our OpenEnergy project. This module is the heart of our energy storage system simulation, and it's where all the magic happens. You can find the complete code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/koulakhilesh/OpenEnergy/). This module is a great example of how to model a battery's behavior in Python.

## Overview

The `battery.py` module contains several classes that model different aspects of a battery's behavior:

- `TemperatureEfficiencyAdjuster`: Adjusts the battery's charging and discharging efficiencies based on temperature.
- `BasicSOHCalculator`: Calculates the battery's State of Health (SOH) based on the energy cycled and depth of discharge (DOD).
- `Battery`: Represents a battery with various properties and methods for charging and discharging.

Let's dive into each of these classes and understand how they work.

## TemperatureEfficiencyAdjuster

This class adjusts the battery's charging and discharging efficiencies based on the temperature. The `adjust_efficiency` method takes in the current temperature and the current efficiencies, and adjusts them based on a simple rule: for every degree Celsius the temperature is away from 25Â°C, the efficiencies decrease by 1%.

```python
def adjust_efficiency(
    self,
    temperature_c: float,
    charge_efficiency: float,
    discharge_efficiency: float,
):
    temp_effect = abs(temperature_c - 25) * 0.01
    new_charge_efficiency = max(0.5, min(charge_efficiency - temp_effect, 1.0))
    new_discharge_efficiency = max(
        0.5, min(discharge_efficiency - temp_effect, 1.0)
    )
    return new_charge_efficiency, new_discharge_efficiency
```

## BasicSOHCalculator

This class calculates the battery's State of Health (SOH) based on the energy cycled and depth of discharge (DOD). The `calculate_soh` method takes in the initial SOH, the amount of energy cycled, and the DOD, and calculates the new SOH based on a degradation rate.

```python
def calculate_soh(self, soh: float, energy_cycled_mwh: float, dod: float):
    base_degradation = 0.000005
    dod_factor = 2 if dod > 0.5 else 1
    degradation_rate = base_degradation * energy_cycled_mwh * dod_factor
    return soh * (1 - degradation_rate)
```

## Battery

This is the main class that represents a battery. It has various properties like capacity, efficiency, state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and temperature. It also has methods for charging and discharging the battery, which adjust the efficiencies and update the SOH and cycle count.

The `charge` and `discharge` methods first adjust the efficiencies based on the temperature, then calculate the actual energy that can be charged or discharged, and finally update the SOC. They also call the `update_soh_and_cycles` method to update the SOH and cycle count.

```python
def charge(self, energy_mwh: float):
    self.adjust_efficiency_for_temperature()
    energy_mwh = min(energy_mwh, self.max_charge_rate_mw * self.duration_hours)
    actual_energy_mwh = energy_mwh * self.charge_efficiency
    self.soc = min(self.soc + actual_energy_mwh / self.capacity_mwh, 1.0)
    self.update_soh_and_cycles(energy_mwh)
```

The `update_soh_and_cycles` method updates the SOH using the `BasicSOHCalculator` and updates the cycle count based on the energy cycled.

```python
def update_soh_and_cycles(self, energy_mwh: float):
    self.energy_cycled_mwh += energy_mwh
    dod = 1.0 - self.soc
    self.soh = self.soh_calculator.calculate_soh(self.soh, energy_mwh, dod)
    self.check_and_update_cycles()
```


## Wrapping Up

That's a brief overview of the `battery.py` module in our OpenEnergy project. We've covered how the module models a battery's behavior, including how it adjusts efficiency based on temperature, calculates the state of health, and handles charging and discharging operations. I hope this gives you a better understanding of how we're simulating energy storage systems in our project. Stay tuned for more deep dives into other parts of the codebase!
